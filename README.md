# Ouph
This is me trying to port Wren's C code to GO. It's name Ouph /ዑፍ/ is a play on Wren's name since Wren is a name of a bird or something.
It's half implemented but opening it to public so that It will be a reminder for the future. It was written before 2 years ago when I was fun of compilers and Go.
